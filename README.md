## Documentation for businesscard 

Paragraph 1-2

The major technologies I used was hmtl, css, and @keyframes. I am early in the coding stage and this is the first product I have done. I learned coding through a website 'code-academy' which was helpful especially with ability to interact while studying. Code-pen is another website that was useful for debugging. There were code snippets of favicon and custom cursor that I borrowed to add more details to my site. I enjoy coding and would love dive deeper and become more confident at it. It is a heavy program to learn just in few weeks and I'm happy how far I've gone.
